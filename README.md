# Wilx — GNU-like tools for Windows

> Wilx provides a small, modular command-line toolkit that brings common GNU-style commands to Windows with familiar flags and behavior. It's implemented in pure Python (standard library), small, fast, and extensible via `core/<command>.py` modules.


Contributions welcome. Create issues or PRs that add commands, tests, or documentation updates. Keep changes small and add tests when behavior changes.
